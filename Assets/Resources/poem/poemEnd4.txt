Why Not?

The threads of fate
Are woven into the soft part of my skull
The same part that aches as I think of my father
The one who left this impression
Within me and upon me
It’s not an act of aggression:
 It’s getting to know me.



Am I the same as I once was?
Before the thunder and lightning tore my skin?
Before i bled for an audience
Waiting for sympathy
Like being in your vision, 
can grant me benediction 

In my dreams
We picked this journey
Knowing the struggles we’d face along the way
Taking life to far so we can see if it is far enough
Knowing exactly which smiles were meant to produce heartache
But choosing it anyways
To grow
To learn from the ways that evil says “I love you”
