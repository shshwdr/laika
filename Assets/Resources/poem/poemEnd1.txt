They Brought You To Me
Through
The clouds curling and curling
In on themselves, the Gossamer lining
Of the world

It was all part of the plan-
Starve you to your bones
To foreclose your throes in the arms of a tin man-
They kissed your nose and wished you bon voyage,
Lovely Laika
You die by pointless stars
