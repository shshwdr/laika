The void whispers it loves you
It whispers you have played the game well
You have infinite potential with you
The void whispered 
You are both yin & yang
You could be good or evil
The darkness you fight comes from within
The truth is
When others hurt us
Our pain and perspective belong to us alone
Within you is a light that can erase all darkness
The void whispers you are not alone
Your ancestors live within your shadow
Your heart swells within your chest
You are not one
You are millions of particles working together
To create life
To create you
The Void Whispered that Magick is real
You can create fantasy
Give someone a reason to smile
All a child needs to fly on a magic carpet
Is a carpet, & imagination
The void whispers to dream.
To escape what ails you
Time heals all wounds
Patience is a virtue
Love comes in seasons
Both Winter & Spring
But bitterness can turn majesty foul
The only spell the void can teach you
Is to paint the future you desire
What you imagine may come to pass
Will you dream?
Or have a nightmare?
The void said. You had completed the game.
