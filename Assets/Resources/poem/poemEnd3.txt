Pain, My Companion

My Lungs.
Feel trapped within a cage.
I am afraid
Breathing
Has become painful
My fear of death
Consumes Me
I wonder.
Who would care if I'm gone.
I wonder.
Why no one is here to care for me.


I dream of what it’s like
To be free of pain
I remember walks in the park.
And the feeling of the wind crashing against my face.

At some point
I felt like I needed something
As if life wasn’t enough.

Today
I learned that my family has cancer.
As my lungs wheeze
I fear for  the worst.
But I know I have something to say.

Cherish life, when you are healthy.
Do not forget the pleasure of an able body, and mind.
Imagine Pain
Inescapable Pain
& Know you cannot relate.
Be proud. Be happy. Have gratitude.
